    <h1>This project is taken from a youtuber: (Kenny Yip Coding)</h1>
    <p>This is one of the projects I made with help of youtube videos for better understanding of JS Canvas.</p>
    <p>The source code is typed over from the video, so don't think this is mine originally.</p>
    <p>Just good at stealing I guess hahaha, good luck playing the game, gonna improve it later so I learn even more!</p>
